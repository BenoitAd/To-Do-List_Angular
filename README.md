# To-Do-List_Angular
First Angular project aimed at learning the core aspects of the framework.

This project is a simple To-Do List application built with Angular. It serves as an introduction to the main concepts of the framework, including components, services, data binding, routing, and form handling.

Features
Add a new task:

Users can add new tasks to the list using a simple input field.
Learning Goal: Understand how to use Angular forms (Template-Driven or Reactive) to handle user inputs, and how to bind form data to components.
Mark tasks as completed:

Users can mark a task as completed, and the UI will update to reflect this change.
Learning Goal: Practice data binding and conditional rendering using Angular directives like *ngIf and *ngFor.
Delete a task:

Users can remove a task from the list.
Learning Goal: Learn how to update component state and use event binding to trigger actions when a button is clicked.
Filter tasks by status (all, completed, pending):

Users can filter the task list to display all tasks, only completed tasks, or only pending tasks.
Learning Goal: Gain experience with component communication, using services to share data between components and handle state changes.
Task persistence with local storage (optional):

Save the list of tasks in the browserâ€™s local storage, so they persist after a page refresh.
Learning Goal: Explore integration with browser APIs and learn how to manage persistent state in a front-end application.
